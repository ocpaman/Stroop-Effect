# Stroop-Effect
In this project, the phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect was investigated. First, a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the experiment was formed, then some data collected from others who have performed the experiment was analyzed and then    statistics were computed to describe the results. The results were interpreted in terms of the hypothesis.
